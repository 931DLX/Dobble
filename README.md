# Dobble sequence generator

Dobble is a card game where any two cards always share one, and only one, matching symbol.

This repository contains code and description of my own algorithm for generation of Dobble cards.
I discovered it trying to understand how other algorithms work, but my solution simplifies the process.

dobble.py implements my algorithm and generates sequences of cards for given, variant number of symbols on each card.
